UniqCharNumbers
===============
<h2>This application takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string.</h2> 
<h2>String with the same characters sequence may be passed several times. The application caches the results, so that when is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result.</h2>
<h2>The application will stop running when you type the word "exit" in a separate line.</h2>
<h3>E.g.:</h3>
***hello World!***  
"d" - 1  
"W" - 1  
" " - 1  
"!" - 1  
"e" - 1  
"r" - 1  
"o" - 2  
"l" - 3  
"h" - 1
